It is our practical train in the sophomore. The aim is to train our
ability to program in a group.
The project is about making a chat program like QQ, including the
software on the customer and the program running on the server.
To solve this problem, we use the TCP between the customer and the server to
make the login information transferred safely, and to the chat info between the customers, we use UDP to make a large amount of info could be transferred.
To conclude, it is a really good experience to me, and I enjoyed a very
happy time.
